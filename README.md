# writeitout.github.io
The website for removing your frustration by writing anything out!
It may be poems, stories, novels or anything you wish
For poems it's nice if you could just also provide an audio with it

I have just created one for myself
1. Now DBMS is required to link all the authors' data
2. CSS For styling purposes, mine is in plain HTML
3. JavaScript for adding interactivity to it

So I require extreme help from people who have worked upon DBMS, CSS, JavaScript.
